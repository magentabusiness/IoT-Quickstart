# Connect u-blox SARA N211 / SODAQ SARA AFF N211 to IoT-Gateway

!> **Prerequisites**
 > * [Install Putty](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html)   
 > * If you are using SODAQ SARA AFF N211 follow this instructions:  
 > [View instructions](https://support.sodaq.com/sodaq-one/sara/)   
 > to load the Passthrough-Sketch (nbIOT_serial_passthrough) on your Arduino then  
 > close ArduinoIDE

## Configure Device
