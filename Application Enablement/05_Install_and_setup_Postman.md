## Import and Configure Postman Environment

Environments

An environment is a set of key-value pairs. The key represents the name of the variable. You can use a data editor to modify an environment.

While working with APIs, you often need different setups for your local machine, the development server, or the production API. Environments let you customize requests using variables so you can easily switch between different setups without changing your requests.

You wonâ€™t have to remember all those values once they are in Postman. You can download environments, save them as JSON files, and upload them later.

You can create, share, duplicate, export, and delete an environment. You can also import an environment as a single JSON file.

Now you need your Application Credentials, which you have downloaded in the first Part of the Tutorial ( [Create your first Application](../01&#32;Create&#32;first&#32;Application.md) )  (Step: Save Secert to Local)  
So open the File and get your AppID and AppSecret
